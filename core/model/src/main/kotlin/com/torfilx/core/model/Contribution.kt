 * - **Session restart.** libtorrent starts counting from zero again, so a value *lower* than the last
 *   one seen is not a decrease — it is a fresh count, and the whole of it is new. Clamping that to
 *   zero (the obvious defensive move) would silently discard everything shared since the restart,
