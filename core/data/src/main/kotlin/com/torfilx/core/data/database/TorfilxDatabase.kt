/**
 * Schemas are exported to `core/data/schemas` and committed, so every future migration is
 * reviewable and testable (plan.md §8.1). `fallbackToDestructiveMigration` is never enabled —
 * losing playback progress on upgrade is not acceptable.
 *
 * Because destructive fallback is off, **bumping [version] without a migration is a hard startup
 * crash on every already-installed device.** To change the schema safely:
 *  1. bump [version];
 *  2. write a `Migration(N, N+1)` and add it to the Room builder in `DataModule`;
 *  3. extend `TorfilxDatabaseMigrationTest` with a `runMigrationsAndValidate(...)` for the new step.
 * The exported JSON under `core/data/schemas` is generated automatically by the Room compiler and
 * must be committed alongside the change — it is the fixture the migration test replays.
