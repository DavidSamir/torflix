 * The app's BitTorrent capability.

 * - nothing starts until the user has explicitly consented to sharing (uploading), because
 *   participating in a swarm means uploading to strangers;
 * - the engine never uses more disk than [StorageBudget] allows, computed from *currently free*
 *   space, so a full TV can never be the app's fault.
