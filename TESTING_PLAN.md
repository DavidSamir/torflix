# Torfilx — Compatibility & Playback Verification Plan

_Last updated: 2026-08-17_

This document captures what we have **proven**, what we have **ruled out**, the full
**Fire TV device matrix** the app must run on, and the **test cases** that remain — so the
work can continue without re-deriving any of it.

---

## 1. The headline finding (read this first)

**The Android emulator cannot test BitTorrent playback, and never could.**

Measured, not assumed:

| Probe (on the API 36 x86_64 emulator) | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `ping 8.8.8.8` | **100% packet loss** |
| DHT nodes after 20s (`session.dhtNodes()`) | **0** |
| HTTPS poster fetch (TCP 443) | **works** |
| Torrent metadata (DHT + UDP trackers) | **times out every time** |

QEMU's user-mode networking forwards **TCP only**. BitTorrent peer discovery is **UDP**
(DHT is UDP; our test magnets carry `udp://` trackers exclusively). So on every emulator:

- Posters load (TCP) → the UI looks healthy.
- No peer is ever found (UDP) → **every** magnet dies with `MetadataTimeout: No peers responded`.

This is a property of the **sandbox**, not the app. It is why three well-seeded magnets
(Big Buck Bunny, Cosmos Laundromat, The Gold Rush) all failed identically regardless of
libtorrent version. **Playback must be verified on real hardware or a network-permissive
device.** More emulator runs cannot answer the playback question.

> The earlier apparent success with libtorrent 2.1 does **not** contradict this: it is not a
> reliable comparison, because 2.1 cannot be used anyway (see §3) and that run was not
> reproduced under the same UDP-blocked conditions.

## 2. Fire TV device matrix (what the APK must support)

Sources: Amazon Fire TV device specifications (developer.amazon.com), Aug 2026.

**Every Fire TV device ever shipped is 32-bit userspace (`armeabi-v7a`).** No Fire TV is
arm64. This is the single most important compatibility fact for our native library.

### Streaming sticks / players

| Device | Year | Fire OS | Android / API | SoC | ABI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fire TV Stick — 1st Gen | 2014 | 5 | 5.1 / **22** | Broadcom Capri 28155 | armeabi-v7a |

### Boxes / Cubes / pendants

| Device | Year | Fire OS | Android / API | ABI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fire TV — 1st Gen | 2014 | 5 | 5.1 / **22** | armeabi-v7a |
| Fire TV — 2nd Gen | 2015 | 5 | 5.1 / **22** | armeabi-v7a |
| Fire TV — 3rd Gen (pendant) | 2017 | 6 | 7.1 / **25** | armeabi-v7a |
| Fire TV Cube — 1st Gen | 2018 | 6 | 7.1 / **25** | armeabi-v7a |
| Fire TV Cube — 2nd Gen | 2019 | 7 | 9 / **28** | armeabi-v7a |
| Fire TV Cube — 3rd Gen | 2022 | 7 | 9 / **28** | armeabi-v7a |

### What this means for the build

- **minSdk 22** is correct and necessary — the oldest live sticks are API 22, and the
  user's own device is a Fire TV Stick 2nd Gen (Fire OS 5.2.9.5, API 22).
- **`armeabi-v7a` is the ABI that matters.** `arm64-v8a` is never used by a Fire TV; we ship
  it for forward-safety and emulators only. `x86`/`x86_64` are emulator-only.
- **API levels to cover: 22, 25, 28, 30.** Four distinct Fire OS generations (5, 6, 7, 8).
- **Vega OS devices (2025–26) are out of scope** — they are not Android and cannot run an
  APK at all. Nothing we do reaches them.

## 3. Why libtorrent version is locked to 1.2.x (proven)

| libtorrent4j build | Loads on API 22? | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1.0-27 … -39 | ❌ No | needs `getifaddrs` (API 24), `aligned_alloc`+`getentropy` (API 28) as **strong** symbols |
| 2.0.x | ❌ No | same class of API 24/28 symbols |
| **1.2.x (1.2.3.0)** | ✅ **Yes** | all undefined symbols resolve against API 22 libc; only `getentropy` is referenced, and it is **weak** (linker tolerates null) |

Verified by dumping every undefined symbol in each ABI's `.so` against the NDK's API 22
stubs. **1.2.3.0 is the only viable engine**, and it publishes an `x86` artifact (2.x does
not), which is what lets the app even *load* on an emulator. Going back to 2.x is not an
option — it cannot load on any Fire TV.

---

## 4. Root-cause work completed on the play path

All committed to the 1.2.3.0 migration; each was a real defect found by reading the
libtorrent4j 1.2 source, not guessing:

1. **API surface** — `download(magnet, dir)` (flags dropped), `Sha1Hash(hexString)`
   (no `from_hex`). ✅ builds & runs.
2. **DHT not auto-started** — 1.2's `start(SessionParams)` does **not** start the DHT from
   `enable_dht` alone. Added explicit `session.startDht()` + `isDhtRunning()` guard. ✅
3. **DHT bootstrap routers** — set `dht_bootstrap_nodes` and `listen_interfaces` explicitly,
   because the settings pack handed to `SessionParams` is the *whole* config (unset = empty). ✅
4. **Torrent added in PAUSED state** — this is the subtle one. 1.2's `download()` strips
   `AUTO_MANAGED` but leaves libtorrent's default `PAUSED` flag, and with no auto-manager the
   torrent **never announces**. libtorrent4j's own `fetchMagnet()` calls `th.resume()` for
   exactly this reason. We now `resume()` the handle the instant it exists. ✅
5. **Diagnostics** — startup logs `Torrent engine available (abi=…, api=…)`; the play path
   logs DHT node count and `Torrent added and resumed`. These make a real-device failure
   readable in one glance.

**Status:** all of the above are **code-complete and load-verified**, but **playback itself
is still unproven** because the only test bed available (emulator) has no UDP. On the
emulator the new logs read exactly as expected for a UDP-blocked host: `DHT nodes after
20000ms: 0`, torrent added and resumed, then metadata timeout.

---

## 5. Confidence assessment

| Claim | Confidence | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App launches on API 22/25/28/30 | **High** | executed on all four |
| Native `libtorrent4j.so` loads on those APIs | **High** | executed + full symbol analysis |
| ARM binary is CPU-compatible with Fire TV | **High** | ELF/ABI/symbol analysis (armeabi-v7a, VFPv3, NEON) |
| UI/artwork/navigation/consent all work | **High** | executed, screenshotted |
| DHT + resume fixes are correct | **Medium** | derived from libtorrent4j 1.2 source; logs behave as predicted, but no peer discovery possible in emulator |
| **Video actually plays on a Fire Stick** | **Unverified** | requires real UDP; emulator cannot test |

---

## 6. Test cases to run on real hardware

Two public-domain films the user supplied (used only in `app/src/debug/assets/`, never in
the shipped catalogue):

- **The Kid (1921)** — `0697BC07EBC5914085C2A3BCE646509086BF6265`
- **The Gold Rush (1925)** — `BB5A1F6D17D3F8E01DE20D42FB9860157A24456C`

### Matrix (each cell = one deterministic run)

| # | Device / API | Title | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Fire TV Stick 2nd Gen (API 22) | The Kid | frames render within ~2 min |
| 2 | Fire TV Stick 2nd Gen (API 22) | The Gold Rush | frames render |
| 3 | API 22 | resume after leaving player | resumes at saved position |
| 4 | API 22 | play with sharing **declined** | clear "cannot play" message, no crash |
| 5 | API 22 | play with no network | typed error, no crash |
| 6+ | API 25 / 28 / 30 (if available) | The Kid + The Gold Rush | frames render |

### What to capture per run (the app already logs these)

```
adb connect <fire-tv-ip>:5555
adb logcat -c
adb shell am start -n com.torfilx.tv/com.torfilx.tv.MainActivity
# play a title, then:
adb logcat -d | grep Torfilx
```

Key lines and how to read them:

| Log line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Torrent engine available (abi=armeabi-v7a, api=22)` | native load OK |
| `DHT nodes after 20000ms: N` | **N > 0 on real hardware = the emulator was the only blocker.** N = 0 on real hardware = a genuine DHT bug to chase |
| `Torrent added and resumed; waiting for metadata` | the PAUSED fix is in effect |
| `state=PLAYING` (MediaSession) | **success — video is playing** |
| `MetadataTimeout: No peers responded` | no peers found (expected on emulator; a real bug on hardware) |

### Decision tree after the first real-hardware run

- **`state=PLAYING` appears** → playback works. Fill in the matrix, then ship the release
  build (with the user's 2000-title catalogue).
- **`DHT nodes > 0` but still `MetadataTimeout`** → DHT is healthy; problem is tracker/peer
  connection. Next step: log `tracker_error_alert` / `tracker_reply_alert` from the alert loop.
- **`DHT nodes = 0` on real hardware** → real DHT bug. Check UDP listen-port binding and
  whether the router is filtering; consider adding an explicit DHT bootstrap with
  `dhtAnnounce` after nodes appear.

---

## 7. Fallbacks (only if 1.2.x proves unworkable on hardware)

1. **Add more/healthier trackers to the catalogue magnets** — the supplied magnets use only
   `udp://` trackers, several long-dead (coppersurfer, leechers-paradise, rarbg). Adding
   live `udp://` + `http://` trackers gives peer discovery a path that does not depend on
   DHT at all. **Cheapest first thing to try if DHT is slow on hardware.**
2. **Pure-JVM BitTorrent engine** (e.g. ttorrent-style) — removes the native ABI problem
   entirely; significant rewrite of `:core:torrent`.
3. **Raise the floor to Fire OS 6+ and use libtorrent 2.x** — abandons the user's own 2nd
   Gen stick and all API 22 hardware. Last resort.

---

## 8. Current repo state

- `app/src/debug/assets/catalog.json` — the two public-domain test films; **debug variant
  only**. Release builds use the real catalogue automatically.
- Release/CI: **v0.1.7 is the published tag**, shipping the user's 2000-title catalogue.
- The DHT-start, bootstrap-nodes, and PAUSED-resume fixes are **local, uncommitted** — they
  are correct by source analysis but not yet playback-verified, so they have not been
  released.
- The user's `core/data/src/main/assets/catalog.json` has **never been modified** (0 diffs).
